// Linked Lists:
// Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used to store collections of elements.
// They consist of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.
// Linked lists can be singly linked (each node points to the next) or doubly linked (each node points to both the next and previous nodes).


// Basic operations on linked lists include:
// 1. Insertion: Adding a new node to the list.
// 2. Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
// 3. Traversal: Visiting each node in the list to access its value.
